These have been consistently published \r\nin “raw” form in its Annual Reports, or been used for various studies in the BIS Economic or Working \r\nPapers series, and, more recently, the Quarterly Review. This paper examines the criteria used for \r\ncollecting such data, the difficulties encountered in compiling them as well as their limitations. Introduction \r\nIn June 1989, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), in its 59th Annual Report,2 correlated, in \r\ngraphical form, the p/e ratio of the Tokyo stock market with the inflation-adjusted price of commercial \r\nreal estate (land) in six major Japanese cities, noting that Japanese corporations held, at the time, a \r\nconsiderable amount of land. A year later, the BIS devoted a whole section on property markets in its \r\nAnnual Report,3 and this was to lead to fairly regular annual publication of the data it had collected in \r\nthis field. By also correlating both residential and commercial property prices with equity prices in the \r\nsame section, it was the forerunner for its work on aggregate asset prices.4 This paper examines the \r\ncriteria behind collecting and evaluating the data for these real estate data, the difficulties encountered \r\nin compiling them as well as the various limitations to the data. The criteria \r\nThere are, generally speaking, for most areas of international data collection, six criteria which need to \r\nbe satisfied from a statistical viewpoint:5 regular availability, representativeness, homogenous \r\ncomparability, unbroken and unchanging description, length of series and data frequency.6 In a perfect \r\nworld, data would be always available for all countries under review, have identical measurement \r\nparameters, not have any breaks in series, go back to an identical (distant) starting point and, finally, \r\nbe available on a monthly basis. Alas, the art of statistics (at least in this field) has been to overcome \r\nthe imperfections found in the real world!","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"dcb79ffe-67b2-4c75-bfec-2277824c0be0":{"id_":"dcb79ffe-67b2-4c75-bfec-2277824c0be0","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"/KNBAgNgiOAR35pC9aPyXwHLm0Gb3RhPcK/CGb5oHzg=","metadata":{},"hash":"22HHinhhg15tHwX7FRE9LFSuCcUvBEhmZ4VurRcn8/A="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"82c24216-31b3-4fff-9dc7-1529c307eae6","metadata":{},"hash":"qTCTVthaObuIeYJrPmmT6m1THHqJxmLdOh6NeMreVxY="}},"hash":"y7EuZDwavqKws8oqvhVkArTKTRlJVgsttXAIaVdfRIs=","text":"Indeed, the IMF established, in 1996, the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to “guide \r\nmembers that have, or that might seek, access to international capital markets in the provision of their \r\neconomic and financial data to the public.

Regular availability \r\nFirst and foremost, data of some sort must be available, and, equally important, be regularly updated. It is therefore only of limited use to the statistician to find a (one-off) piece of research containing data: \r\nthe best that can be hoped for is that the original data sources are given and that such data can be \r\nprovided by these sources on a regular basis. Unfortunately, for international institutions such as the \r\nBIS, such data collection often has to rely on the goodwill and understanding of a commercial data \r\nprovider or real estate association, and experience has shown that it is here that the greatest \r\nlikelihood in the disruption in the flow of data can occur.8 What sort of data is ideally sought is often \r\ntempered by what is found. By the early 1990s, the BIS had already managed to contact several national statistical institutions and \r\nprivate real estate associations9 and was able to publish data illustrating the development in \r\nresidential and commercial real estate for more than a dozen capital cities.10 Although this was an \r\nimportant starting point, the obvious disadvantages of such a localised focus required further work.11 In \r\naddition, the close correlation between office rents and commercial property prices observed in the \r\n1970s and the early 1980s ended with the office property boom observed in many countries in the late \r\n1980s (and the equally dramatic subsequent decline less than a decade later). The Bank therefore \r\napproached other data providers, or went back to its earlier sources, to enquire what else was \r\navailable. Representativeness \r\nData should be representative of present day values, but this is indeed a delicate issue. Just as it is no \r\nlonger relevant in the industrial countries to include the price of a horse in its consumer price index \r\nunder the sub-category transport, the price of a house will no longer include an outside toilet,12 but will \r\nprobably have several bathrooms, of which at least one may be en suite.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"24ed2dc0-08fc-40b2-8b65-abc1e07bb993":{"id_":"24ed2dc0-08fc-40b2-8b65-abc1e07bb993","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"wCx5E5OXtCCgVYVV0SCkSrBkXUoOkBUZTkQ7ly5oq2I=","metadata":{},"hash":"P90PcG54PXmVfo7TuzRHoCkjjwk29yYg5P9P35Mg6ck="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1490d64e-963a-46f6-807b-107e1ffae727","metadata":{},"hash":"l4TVhkj2VEzU7RLKrgFLTwq7Xl5WcnsqXrpK6zgLrV8="}},"hash":"6+0bnMMlphlZkFeupS5rfod+rmykKNAnibpn/a+ogk4=","text":"Similarly, today’s offices will \r\nhave IT facilities which were in the realms of science fiction a generation ago.

Even within a country, what is representative in one region is not at all in \r\nanother: the majority of housing in the North of England - a traditionally industrial region in the United \r\nKingdom - is terrassed, but detached houses are the standard in the South-West - a part of the \r\ncountry to which many retire. Comparability \r\nIt is unlikely that data for a group of countries will be, in all aspects, comparable. First, as explained \r\nabove, that which is considered to be representative in one country may not be so in another. Secondly, the method used to collect data may vary and influence the result. For example, a survey \r\ncan be conducted by approaching those real estate agents who are members of a national guild: this \r\nis unlikely to represent, in some countries, the majority of transactions. Alternatively, the registered \r\nlending agencies may be asked for information on housing based on the mortgages they grant: here, \r\ncash transactions would escape the net. Notaries could also be approached in those countries where \r\ntheir services are mandatory in finalising property transactions: in order to keep fees down, however, \r\npart of the agreed price may be paid in cash and another, lower, price communicated to the notary. Finally, government agencies may provide data, but their original source may be any of the above or \r\nbe a result of calculations stemming from tax returns.13 \r\nThirdly, as hinted earlier, the focus may vary considerably. From a macro-economic viewpoint, and, in \r\nparticular, for the BIS’s recent work on a set of indicators to predict financial crises, a nationwide \r\ncoverage of property prices is clearly the most desirable. However, especially for commercial property, \r\nthis is not always available,14 so that, for several countries, the BIS has to fall back on data relating to \r\nprime property in a capital city’s centre.15 Nevertheless, the appearance in recent years of nationwide \r\ndata16 indicates that a commercial property price index typically has 80% of the total drawn from \r\nproperty in that country’s capital.

A simple average of the \r\nprices paid in the individual regions may be taken (Canada) or a weighted average (based on, for \r\nexample, the population) of the regional survey results (Australia). The index may be the price paid by \r\narea rather than unit: this often makes sense for commercial property, but is also occasionally true for \r\nresidential property (eg France, Italy, Spain). Finally, there is no guarantee that an index is being compiled at all, but that the series is expressed in, \r\nfor example, national currency. Indeed, this may well be preferable, since there is a clear loss of \r\ninformation in a simple index.17 Although this is unavoidable for cross-country comparison,18 data \r\nproviders would be advised to keep their series in as “original” a state as possible. 13   For example, in Switzerland, a tax (the “Handänderungssteuer”, literally, change-of-hands tax) is levied on each sale of \r\nsecond-hand property, which is based on the sale price, so that an average price is simple to calculate. However, none is \r\nlevied on new property which, in an under-developed property market (relative to demand) as currently exists in Switzerland, \r\nforms a substantial proportion. 14    Available in the sense that they also satisfy the other criteria. 15    For example, as provided by Jones Lang LaSalle. These data, however, are also available for a number of Asian-Pacific \r\ncities, of which they are, to the best of my knowledge, the sole providers on a collective basis. 16    Calculated by, for example, Investment Property Databank Ltd. 17   For example, a table showing the price of a “standard” dwelling (or, better, the price per square metre) for a group of \r\ncountries in a given year is clearly better than a simple index value which can, at best, only show the relative position - \r\ndependent on the base year chosen - or growth rate from that base year. 18    This raises an interesting point: no attempt has, to my knowledge, been made in comparing exchange-rate-adjusted data.

This also reflects \r\nthe data situation today, but even now, as then, the indices vary in their composition of flats, terrassed \r\nor detached houses, single or multiple-occupied dwellings etc. Continuity \r\nThis important criteria, for continuous assessment, requires little explanation, but it is, in reality, one of \r\nthe most common problems facing statisticians. Apart from the possibility (see “Availability” above) \r\nthat a source may “dry up” and need to be replaced by another which will almost certainly differ in \r\ndefinition (if not frequency, which is another problem, see below), data from the same source may \r\nsuddenly change. One reason may be that the source is itself not the primary collector of data, but \r\neither the collator or just simply the disseminating body.21 To be fair, breaks in series often herald an \r\nimprovement in the data, becoming either more encompassing or moving to a higher frequency (or \r\nboth). “Splicing” with the previous series, however, remains a difficult problem. Length of series \r\nThis problem is often linked to the previous criteria, since a radical break in series can, if no splicing \r\ncan be done, considerably shorten a previously lengthy series. Also, when data providers and, by \r\nproxy, the Bank, embark on an extended country coverage, it is usually not possible for them to \r\n(re)construct a historical series. A table showing the last five years does not, in this respect, pose the \r\nsame problem as attempts to graph price developments since the 1970s or to carry out historical \r\nresearch analysis (see also below). Frequency \r\nPrecisely in this area of historical analysis, data frequency tends to pose little problem, since most \r\nresearch is done over a fairly long time horizon. Generally speaking, property prices are not thought of \r\nas being particularly volatile from one quarter to the next, so that annual data are sufficient.

Given the \r\n‘public good’ properties of the data, there seems to be a good case for official authorities to put efforts \r\ninto this area. ” \r\n                                                      \r\n23   Claudio Borio and Philip Lowe (2002): “Asset prices, financial and monetary stability: exploring the nexus”, BIS Working \r\nPapers, no 114, July.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7f26d901-1bc1-4fdd-9b7d-8007b8a0883e":{"id_":"7f26d901-1bc1-4fdd-9b7d-8007b8a0883e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"3agxZH5LSJHeDj0nZH5sRiM2vyiMSPU70fPYSF0uwEY=","metadata":{},"hash":"LIbgjV5F1lPahr7IZRHf4Hr4+JX6Gor3X7/oQMh5EMw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d32f7177-7827-4dc9-82c1-c6f5b88d0efd","metadata":{},"hash":"Zx+ro/QJAfL6O+VFOpzILSsxlylp6J9oaZWWiKOGRVo="}},"hash":"Cz8hQ0ZM3r9eYu9AUMAe996sf6W6+bq56DSctEvrf2s=","text":"68 BIS Papers No 21\r\n \r\nAppendix \r\nThe table below show the countries for which the author, in his capacity as statistical analyst, \r\nmaintains, respectively, residential and commercial property price data, their frequencies, unit (or base \r\nperiod) and start date.
